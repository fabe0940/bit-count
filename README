SUMMARY

This project is a simple project, more about becoming familiar with the
LC3 instruction set and toolchain than solving a difficult problem. The
purpose is to examine the value pre-loaded into the first register (R0)
and store the number of set bits into the eigth register (R7).


BUILING

This project must be built using the LC3 assembler and toolchain
available here:

Once the tools are build and/or installed, the project can be built
with the following commands.

$ echo "fix this later"


RUNNING

Because the LC3 processor is a simplified and hypothetical processor
created for use in introductory-level computer architecture classes,
there is no way to run this program with actual hardware. Instead, one
must download and install the LC3 simulator available at:

Once the simulator is build and/or installed, launch it.

$ /path/to/lc3sim

The simulator will present you with a prompt. From here, I don't know
what to do yet.
